// 1. Artificial Intelligence anything that enables computers to mimic humans.
// 2. Machine learning is a subset of AI. ML is machines improving with experience.
// 3. Deep learing -- speech, image recognition is a subset of ML. 
//    inspired by the human brain, learn from large amounts of data


/** SUPERVISED LEARNING */
// Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function 
//that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs


/*** UNSUPERVISED LEARNING */
// Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels


/** NEURAL NETWORKS */
// A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize 
// underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics 
// the way the human brain operates

/** NEURAL NETS */
// Neural nets are a means of doing machine learning, in which a computer learns to 
// perform some task by analyzing training examples.

// Text mining is a process of exploring sizeable textual data and find patterns. 
// Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the components of text mining.
// String classification is a subset of NLP.

/*** RNN */
// Recurrent Neural Networks are one of the most common Neural Networks used in 
// Natural Language Processing because of its promising results.
// We can either make the model(learning data) and predict or guess the sentences for us and 
// or we can train the model on particular 
// Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) are a type of Neural Network 
// where the output from previous steps are fed as input to the current step.
// RNN have a “memory” which remembers all information about what has been calculated.
 
/**LSTM is a subset*/ 
// Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network 
// LSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions 
// based on data.
// The past state, the current memory and the present input work 
// together to predict the next output.
